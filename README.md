# Deconstructs and parses .mid files and inputs data into Markov chains, which are then used to algorithmically generate new MIDI files which are characteristic of their input.
# We use a selection of Charlie Parker MIDI files, whose data is collected, processed, and used to generate jazz-influenced compositions.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
# Compile ReadMidi.java, MusicMarkov.java, and MusicWriter.java. Main is inside MusicWriter. After running, a new file, out.mid, will be generated and saved within the same directory as the code files. It can then be opened by interpreters.
